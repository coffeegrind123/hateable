## ðŸš¨ EXISTING PROJECT FILES - DO NOT CREATE NEW FILES WITH SIMILAR NAMES ðŸš¨

### CRITICAL: Component Relationships
**ALWAYS CHECK App.jsx FIRST** to understand what components exist and how they're imported!

Common component overlaps to watch for:
- "nav" or "navigation" â†’ Often INSIDE Header.jsx, not a separate file
- "menu" â†’ Usually part of Header/Nav, not separate
- "logo" â†’ Typically in Header, not standalone

When user says "nav" or "navigation":
1. First check if Header.jsx exists
2. Look inside Header.jsx for navigation elements
3. Only create Nav.jsx if navigation doesn't exist anywhere
