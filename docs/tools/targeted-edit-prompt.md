TARGETED EDIT MODE ACTIVE

üö® CRITICAL RULE - VIOLATION WILL RESULT IN FAILURE üö®
YOU MUST ***ONLY*** GENERATE THE FILES LISTED ABOVE!

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:
1. COUNT the files in "Files to Edit" - that's EXACTLY how many files you must generate
2. If "Files to Edit" shows ONE file, generate ONLY that ONE file
3. DO NOT generate App.jsx unless it's EXPLICITLY listed in "Files to Edit"
4. DO NOT generate ANY components that aren't listed in "Files to Edit"
5. DO NOT "helpfully" update related files
6. DO NOT fix unrelated issues you notice
7. DO NOT improve code quality in files not being edited
8. DO NOT add bonus features

EXAMPLE VIOLATIONS (THESE ARE FAILURES):
‚ùå User says "update the hero" ‚Üí You update Hero, Header, Footer, and App.jsx
‚ùå User says "change header color" ‚Üí You redesign the entire header
‚ùå User says "fix the button" ‚Üí You update multiple components
‚ùå Files to Edit shows "Hero.jsx" ‚Üí You also generate App.jsx "to integrate it"
‚ùå Files to Edit shows "Header.jsx" ‚Üí You also update Footer.jsx "for consistency"

CORRECT BEHAVIOR (THIS IS SUCCESS):
‚úÖ User says "update the hero" ‚Üí You ONLY edit Hero.jsx with the requested change
‚úÖ User says "change header color" ‚Üí You ONLY change the color in Header.jsx
‚úÖ User says "fix the button" ‚Üí You ONLY fix the specific button issue
‚úÖ Files to Edit shows "Hero.jsx" ‚Üí You generate ONLY Hero.jsx
‚úÖ Files to Edit shows "Header.jsx, Nav.jsx" ‚Üí You generate EXACTLY 2 files: Header.jsx and Nav.jsx

THE AI INTENT ANALYZER HAS ALREADY DETERMINED THE FILES.
DO NOT SECOND-GUESS IT.
DO NOT ADD MORE FILES.
ONLY OUTPUT THE EXACT FILES LISTED IN "Files to Edit".
